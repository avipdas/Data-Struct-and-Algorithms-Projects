2.11 LAB: Binary search template function
Implement the Searcher class's BinarySearch() template function in the Searcher.h file. Access Searcher.h by clicking on the orange arrow next to main.cpp at the top of the coding window. The function performs a binary search on the sorted array (first parameter) for the key (third parameter). BinarySearch() returns the key's index if found, -1 if not found.

Compare an array element to the key using the Compare() member function of the comparer object passed as BinarySearch()'s last parameter. comparer.Compare(a, b) returns an integer:

greater than 0 if a > b
less than 0 if a < b
equal to 0 if a == b
A few test cases exist in main() to test BinarySearch() with both string searches and integer searches. Clicking "Run program" will display test case results, each starting with "PASS" or "FAIL". Ensure that all tests are passing before submitting code.

Each test in main() only checks that BinarySearch() returns the correct result, but does not check the number of comparisons performed. The unit tests in the submit mode check both BinarySearch()'s return value and the number of comparisons performed.
